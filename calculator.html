      I modified multiple aspects of this implementation as it did not approach
      multi digit numbers correctly or involve decimal floating point numbers, or
      utilize '-' as a unary or binary operation for negation/subtraction.

      This algorithm also did not implement or consider math functions such as ln() and log()
      which require a single parameter, as well as trig functions sin, cos, mtan, and cot
      which I then implemented.
